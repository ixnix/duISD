# About
duISAD is a global, homogenized weather station-based dust-climate dataset (duISD) in support of wind erosion monitoring, dust source mapping, and dust-climate analysis at local to global scales. The main data source is the NOAA Integrated Surface Database (ISD), merged with climate information from external sources.

duISD v1 [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4107346.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4107346) consists of CSV files for individual weather stations, which contain the monthly dust event frequency and dust extinction coefficient derived from the SYNOP reports of presentw weather and visibility archieved in ISD. The temporal coverage varies by station, with some stations going back to the 1950s. Refer to the README file for details on the data files.
